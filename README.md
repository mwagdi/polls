# Polls App

React/Redux app created using [Polls API](https://pollsapi.docs.apiary.io/)

## Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/mwagdi/polls.git
cd polls
npm install
```
Due to experiencing a CORS error trying to access the API, a proxy server was created using Node.js. So instead of running `npm start` like you would do with create-react-app, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the proxy server and start the React development server
